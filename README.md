# dips-giphy

Created a GIPHY app using GIPHY API key to make a dynamic web page that populates with my favorite artist gifs.

Technologies used: HTML | CSS | JavaScript & Jquery | AJAX | GIPHY API 

How the GIPHY-app works: 

	* On page load, you will see 8 buttons on top of the page with my favorite artists.

	* When you click on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

	* If you click on one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If you click the gif again, it should stop playing.

	* Above every gif, it will display its rating (PG, G, so on).
	  
	* You can choose to add an artist of your choice by using the form to the right of the page. Once you input an artist and click submit, a new button with the artist name will generate.
